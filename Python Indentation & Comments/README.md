# Indentation And Comments in Python

Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

Python Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them.

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.

Multi Line Comments
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line
