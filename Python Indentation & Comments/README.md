# Indentation And Comments in Python

Python Indentation:

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

Python Comments:

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them.

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line.

Multi Line Comments
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line
